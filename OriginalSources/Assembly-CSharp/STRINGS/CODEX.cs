That number is steadily rising as broadband satellite megaconstellations continue to expand.\n\n\"We're developing a way to break up large, at-risk space objects in the thermosphere so that our team can safely deorbit the remaining fragments.\" Dr. Stern explained.\n\nWhen asked about critiques that Gravitas might use this opportunity to obtain proprietary technology or undertake unauthorized satellite placement, Dr. Stern scoffed. \"Our only agenda is the protection and advancement of the human species.\"\n\nA live-streamed press conference is scheduled for the end of this week.";

Their explorations, ideas, hopes, and breakthroughs illuminate ours, and give us a reason to keep pushing forward. Science is our vehicle, but people—friends, strangers, and rivals alike—are our purpose.\"\n\nThat's the short version of the monologue that Dr. Austin Higby delivered at least once a week.\n\nDr. Higby was a staunch advocate of collaboration. His research took astrobiology into exciting new territory, a feat he attributed to the contributions of co-authors and sources from every branch of science. He also had a deep appreciation for the arts. Many of his colleagues attended their first theater production at his invitation, myself included.\n\nDuring one of his rotations at the Gravitas Facility, I asked him how he found time for it all. He laughed. \"It finds <i>me!</i>\"\n\nThree months later, he and the crew of the Starsweep II vanished while on a now-infamous mission for the Clear Skies Coalition. No trace of their spacecraft has ever been found.\n\nThen these writings were discovered among Dr. Higby's personal files. Dozens upon dozens of poems and essays so profound that they make the reader feel transported to another place and time...one that feels at once familiar and completely alien.\n\n<i>Swept Into the Stars</i> is a labour of love by countless friends, colleagues, students, and fans who worked tirelessly to organize and edit Dr. Higby's words.\n\nWith permission from the Higby family, this edition also includes the farewell speech he had penned for the retirement announcement he never had a chance to make.\n\nHigby would be equal parts proud and embarrassed.\n\nI miss you, my friend.

It's a little wrinkled now.\n\nEverybody else's lab coats are also wrinkled, though, and I bet at least ONE other person has ferret fur on theirs too.\n\nNo one else from my program got hired, but I'm already starting to get to know my new colleagues. In the cafeteria today, I offered someone a bite of my fish noodle sandwich, and she said \"Gross, ew! Get that away from me!\"\n\nSo now I know she doesn't like sandwiches!\n\nI was surprised, because she'd been staring since I unwrapped it. Maybe she just liked the starry print on the wrap?

It's a pleasure to be back.\n\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\n\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\n\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\n\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet.

Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\n\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\n\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\n\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\n\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\n\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\n\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\n\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\n\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\n\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\n\nFlorence: I could show you.

The monitor is now displaying multiple shipping confirmation messages, despite the target building remaining in the departure dock. Reports show that an unknown number of access point blueprints have been disseminated. One shipment does appear to have reached Ceres, luckily, though it's quite far from the landing site.\n\nDr. Ali's entire team is working to determine how many others exist, and pinpoint their geographic and temporal locations.\n\nI am not optimistic.\n\nThe geologists insist that their equipment has recorded no seismic activity at all for several days.\n\nIt begs the question: What <i>was</i> it, if not an earthquake?
